# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all contributors, researchers, and educators. Our goal is to transform physics education through AI-driven Socratic tutoring, and we expect all community members to act in alignment with this mission. 

As a research-driven project, we value intellectual honesty, pedagogical rigor, and the privacy of the students we serve.

## 🚀 Mission-Specific Standards
In addition to standard professional behavior, Scorpio contributors are expected to:

1.  **Respect Pedagogical Integrity**: Understand that Scorpio is a tutoring engine, not an "answer engine." Contributions should enhance the Socratic method and 0% Direct Answer Rate (DAR) philosophy.
2.  **Uphold Academic Integrity**: Do not contribute code or prompts designed to bypass our 4-layer constraint architecture or facilitate academic dishonesty.
3.  **Prioritize Physics Accuracy**: Ensure that all domain-specific contributions (LaTex rendering, formula builders, AI prompts) maintain the highest standards of physics derivation.
4.  **Protect Student Privacy**: Maintain strict adherence to COPPA/FERPA-aligned practices as outlined in our Privacy Policy.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
*   Using welcoming and inclusive language.
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints, especially regarding pedagogical strategies.
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism on code or AI prompt engineering.
*   Focusing on what is best for the student's learning journey.
*   Showing empathy towards teachers and students using the platform.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Intentional attempts to disrupt the pedagogical guardrails of the AI.
*   Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **rushil.mahadevu@gmail.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
