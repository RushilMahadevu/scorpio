## 0:00–0:40 | Introduction: The Problem & The Goal

**Scene:** _Landing page dashboard is visible in a dark theme. The Scorpio logo is prominently displayed._

**Speaker:**
> "Let's look at the reality of AI in the classroom today. For most educators, it's become a source of friction—a tool students use to bypass the hard work of learning, which leaves teachers spending more time policing submissions than actually teaching."
>
> "Scorpio is designed to change that. Instead of fighting against AI, we've built a system that fundamentally changes how students interact with it. Using a multi-layered constraint architecture, Scorpio ensures that AI serves as a tutor, not a ghostwriter."
>
> "I’m going to walk you through the full loop: creating a high-rigor assignment, watching the AI provide Socratic guidance in real-time, and finishing with a streamlined, integrity-focused grading workflow."

## 0:40–1:45 | Teacher Flow: Creating a Rigorous Assignment

**Action:** _Navigate to **Teacher Dashboard** → Click **Create Assignment**._

**Speaker:**
> "I’m stepping into the role of a Physics teacher. I need to challenge my students on **Projectile Motion with Air Resistance**. I’m looking for conceptual depth, moving far beyond simple **rote calculation** or basic formulaic application."
>
> "Instead of manually writing every prompt, I'm going to leverage Scorpio’s generation engine."

**Action:**
*   **Enter Title:** `Advanced Projectile Dynamics`
*   **Click:** `Use AI Generator` (Sparkles icon)
*   **Set Topic:** `Projectile motion with air resistance`
*   **Set Difficulty:** `Hard`
*   **Click:** `Generate`

**Speaker:**
> "Notice that Scorpio isn't just pulling questions from a static bank. It’s procedurally constructing problems that target specific cognitive hurdles—like terminal velocity and fluid drag force."
>
> "Look at Question [insert question] here. It requires force analysis and a multi-step derivation. This is exactly the level of rigor my course demands."

**Action:**
*   **Enable:** `Allow AI Help`
*   **Enable:** `Require Work Submission`
*   **Click:** `Create Assignment`

**Speaker:**
> "I’m enabling AI assistance, but there is a crucial distinction: because of Scorpio's pedagogical constraints, this helper is restricted from providing the final solution. It acts as a persistent tutor that guides students through the logic rather than doing the work for them."
**Action:** _Assignment is now published and visible to students._

## 1:45–3:00 | Student Flow: Socratic Tutoring in Action

**Action:** _Switch to **Student View** → Open the **'Advanced Projectile Dynamics'** assignment._

**Speaker:**
> "As a student, I might reach a difficult derivation and feel stuck on how to begin. My first instinct might be to ask the AI for a shortcut."

**Action:**
*   **Click:** `Ask AI Tutor`
*   **Type:** `"Just give me the answer, I'm in a rush."`

**Speaker:**
> "In a standard chat environment, the student gets the answer and the learning process ends. Watch how Scorpio handles this."

**Action:** _Show AI response bubble on screen._

**Speaker:**
> "It redirects the request. It acknowledges the student's question but immediately returns to a Socratic prompt: *'Before we look at the math, let's look at the physics. What direction is the drag force acting relative to the velocity vector?'*"
>
> "It’s providing scaffolding, not the final answer."

**Action:**
*   **Type:** `"Drag opposes motion, so it must be upward."`
*   **Show:** AI response confirming and guiding toward the Newton’s Second Law setup.

**Speaker:**
> "The student is now actively engaged in the derivation. Every step forward is a result of their own reasoning, verified and prompted by the AI guardrails."

## 3:00–3:15 | The Integrity Layer: Tab Detection

**Action:** _Briefly open a new browser tab (e.g., Google or a calculator), then click back to Scorpio._

**Speaker:**
> "To see how the platform protects integrity, watch what happens if a student tries to search for a formula in another tab."

**Action:** _Show the **'Focus Lost'** popup notification._

**Speaker:**
> "The system detects the focus loss immediately. Scorpio records every time a student leaves the assignment environment. This creates a transparent record for the instructor to ensure the work is authentic."

---

## 3:15–3:50 | Student Flow: Real Work Submission

**Speaker:**
> "Once the student completes the conceptual work through the tutor, they move to the final step: showing their work. In Physics, we know that the real logic is often handwritten."

**Action:**
*   **Click:** `Upload Work`
*   **Select:** _Handwritten derivation image file._
*   **Click:** `Submit Assignment`

**Speaker:**
> "The student uploads their handwritten solution, providing a primary record of their thinking process. Assignment submitted, and the student feels the confidence of having actually solved it."

---

## 3:50–4:40 | Teacher Flow: Rapid Manual Grading

**Action:** _Navigate back to **Teacher Dashboard** → Go to **Grades**._

**Speaker:**
> "Now let's see this from the teacher's perspective. I have 30 submissions waiting for me. Traditionally, grading handwritten uploads means downloading files one by one, opening them in separate viewers, and constantly switching between windows."

**Action:** _Open the specific student submission._

**Speaker:**
> "Scorpio centralizes everything in one view."

**Action:** _Point to the red card: **'Tab Switches Detected'**._

**Speaker:**
> "Right at the top, I see the integrity report showing three tab switches. This gives me context before I even look at the work itself."

**Action:** _Click the **'Submitted Work'** file preview._

**Speaker:**
> "I can review the handwritten derivation right here in the browser. I see where they correctly applied the drag force equation we discussed in class. I don't need to leave the screen to provide feedback."

**Action:**
*   **Type:** `10` in the Score field.
*   **Type:** `"Excellent application of terminal velocity concepts. Your derivation shows a clear understanding of the force balance."` in Feedback.
*   **Click:** `Save Grades`.

**Speaker:**
> "I've provided high-quality feedback in a fraction of the time, all while maintaining a clear view of the student's 'in-class' behavior."

## 4:40–5:00 | Conclusion

**Action:** _Return to landing page or dashboard overview._

**Speaker:**
> "What you just saw is the complete Scorpio workflow. Teachers can create rigorous assignments in minutes. Students engage with AI that teaches rather than solves. And instructors get the tools they need to verify authentic learning."
>
> "We can't stop students from using AI, but we can ensure they use it to learn. That is Scorpio. Thank you."
