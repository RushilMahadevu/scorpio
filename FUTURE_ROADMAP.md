# Future Roadmap: Scorpio Physics Platform

## Phase 1: Immediate Improvements & Polish
- [ ] **Student Grades View**: Complete the implementation of the student grades page to show detailed breakdown of scores.
- [ ] **Resource Organization**: Add categories or tags to "Resource Uploads" (e.g., "Notes", "Practice", "Video") for better filtering.
- [ ] **Assignment Feedback**: Allow teachers to provide specific text feedback comments alongside numerical grades.
- [ ] **Profile Settings**: Allow users (students/teachers) to update their profiles (avatars, display names).
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Audit and improve mobile view for complex tables and assignment interfaces.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Learning Experience
- [ ] **Context-Aware AI Tutor**: Upgrade the AI Tutor to have context of the specific assignment or problem the student is working on.
- [ ] **Rich Text Editor**: Implement a WYSIWYG editor for creating assignments (support images, LaTeX formulas directly in text).
- [ ] **Real-time Notifications**: Notify students when a new assignment is posted or graded (In-app or Email).
- [ ] **Discussion Forums**: Per-class or per-assignment discussion threads for peer-to-peer help.
- [ ] **Practice Mode**: Allow students to generate their own practice problems based on topics they are weak in.

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Gamification
- [ ] **Class Insights**: Visual graphs for teachers showing class average trends over time.
- [ ] **Student Progress Tracking**: "Mastery" tracking for specific physics topics (e.g., Kinematics, Forces) based on assignment tags.
- [ ] **Gamification**: Badges for completing assignments on time, streaks, or high scores.
- [ ] **Export Options**: PDF export for assignment submissions and grade reports.

## Phase 4: Infrastructure & Scale
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admin panel to manage teachers and school-wide settings.
- [ ] **Offline Support**: PWA capabilities for students with poor internet connection.
- [ ] **Integration**: LTI support to integrate with other LMS (Canvas, Google Classroom).
- [ ] **Bulk Import**: Allow teachers to bulk import students via CSV.
