> **Transforming Physics Education through AI-Driven Socratic Tutoring.**

Scorpio is a research-driven educational platform engineered to transform physics instruction. By integrating a novel **4-layer AI constraint architecture** with a high-performance, space-themed interface, Scorpio bridges the gap between traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) and the dynamic cognitive requirements of physics problem-solving.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

Scorpio's architecture is built for concurrency, type safety, and real-time synchronization.

### 🛡️ The 4-Layer Constraint System
At the heart of Scorpio's AI tutoring capabilities is a proprietary constraint architecture designed to ensure pedagogical validity and eliminate hallucinations.

[**📄 View Full System Architecture (PDF)**](./public/architecture.pdf)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The system enforces strict adherence through four distinct layers:

| Layer  | Constraint      | Purpose                                                      |
| :----- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **01** | **Domain**      | Restricts knowledge exclusively to physics principles.       |
| **02** | **Pedagogical** | Enforces the Socratic method; direct answers are prohibited. |
| **03** | **Notation**    | Mandates proper LaTeX formatting and SI unit adherence.      |
| **04** | **Composite**   | Synchronizes all layers for research-grade tutoring.         |

#### Prompt Layering

### 🔄 Data & Synchronization
- **Real-Time State:** Powered by **Cloud Firestore** with optimistic UI updates for zero-latency interaction.
- **Asset Management:** Client-side processed submissions (PDFs/Images) stored via optimized base64 in **Firebase Storage**.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

### 🎓 Research-Grade AI Tutoring
The Scorpio AI Tutor is a **context-aware pedagogical agent**, not a generic chatbot.
- **Context Retention:** Maintains deep awareness of specific assignments and problem states.
- **Adaptive Guidance:** Dynamically scales hint complexity based on student performance.
- **Academic Integrity:** Hardened against jailbreak attempts and direct-answer harvesting.

### 🔢 Advanced Mathematical Rendering
Precision is non-negotiable in physics. Our custom rendering engine includes:
- **KaTeX Integration:** Blazing fast client-side LaTeX rendering.
- **Visual Math Builder:** An intuitive UI for constructing complex equations without raw LaTeX knowledge.

### 🌌 Immersive User Experience
A "Space-Themed" aesthetic designed to reduce cognitive load and boost engagement.
- **Parallax Depth:** Multi-layered backgrounds powered by **Framer Motion**.
- **Glassmorphism:** Context-aware `backdrop-blur` interfaces using **Radix UI** primitives.

## 🔬 Research & Efficacy

Scorpio includes a dedicated research dashboard to monitor the performance of its AI architecture. System metrics track:

- **Rule Adherence %**: The frequency with which the AI successfully maintains Socratic constraints.
- **Response Quality**: Automated evaluation of pedagogical relevance and clarity.
- **Token Efficiency**: Optimization of prompt length versus output quality to reduce latency.

> [!TIP]
> **Data Insight:** *Experimental results indicate that the Full Constraint Stack significantly outperforms standard models in educational utility, maintaining a high quality score across varying difficulty levels.*
